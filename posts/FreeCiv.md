It’s Civilization but free. Contains rules variants to mimic Civ 1, 2, 3, and the ability to make hex style maps like 5 and 6. Worth checking out if you want a free civ and has several offshoots, the most interesting of which is an MMO “RTS” (their words not mine) take on civilization called [https://gaborauth.itch.io/pop-e]{Power of Planets - Earth}. Both are worth checking out and putting some time into. As a bonus both should run on literal toasters.
