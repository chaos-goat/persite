I love logistics games, and city building games, and trains. But sometimes I just cannot handle OpenTTD's or Factorio's nonsense after working in the spreadsheet/SQL mines all day. Enter this adorable, tiny, train logistics game. Soko Loco is part of Sokpop's "Infinite Game Jam", a years long effort in which they released a game every 2 weeks for 3+ years before *"slowing down"* to 1 game a month. Their ideas aren't always fully baked but they're almost always interesting. Soko Loco is simple enough I don't have much to say about it but it's a satisfying pick up and deliver logistics puzzle that my burnt out from work brain can play for a bit and be satisified with. And it's cute as hell.
