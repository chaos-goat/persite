Nethack in space sounds awesome right? Really if we're being honest it's more like Star Control's Melee mode with a light ARPG (think Diablo) grafted on. You're compelled by a goddess that may or may not be real to make a pilgrimage to the galactic core which brings you into conflict with *checks notes* **everyone**. The game makes a pretty bold choice by keeping you stuck in your starting ship for the entire game and includes that sweet sweet permadeath. Moddable, free, and in development for years with paid for content packs to support continuing development this game packs a hell of a punch for the price. Highly recommended.
