Your mission: Survive as long as possible. How do you do that? Destroy the infinite hordes of enemy ships that are coming for you. Your tools? Upgrades based off of the amount of kills you're getting. Get shot down? If you managed to blow up enough enemies to turn into a flying tank (yeah, rule of cool is in effect here) you'll just pop out in your basic fighter jet form still ready to fight. You'll get a sweet damage boost to boot and you can repeat that 5 times. Fast paced, high skill ceiling and quick 5 - 10 minute runs make this an easy game to recommend if you need a daily score attack fix. Put on some heavy metal and blast away in a flow state.
