It's Quake 1. Just y'know add a surprisingly deep crafting system, roguelite permadeath, procedural level generation (*and accompanying difficulty*), and make the POV top down. Does that sound like a lot? Cool I'm not done yet. The levels are labyrinthine. Then the game is extremely punishing which will require you to hone your survival heuristics to a keen edge and you're gonna need to learn to think on the fly to deal with the unexpected. Sound fun? *Oh yeah* the **sound** of the game, it's **loud**, *crunchy* and ***disorienting***. The guns sound like they're shredding themselves to pieces as you fire them. This game is an absolute blast and is one of my favorite "modern" roguelikes.
