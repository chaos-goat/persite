An FPS remake of sorts of the light gun arcade game we all remember from our youths, Area 51 was made free because development was sponsored by the US Air Force. Go to Lucas C’s Area 51 Patches Guide and follow the instructions to install. Fun romp, worth your time if you’re broke or just want something fun for free. Multiplayer is shockingly fun too.
