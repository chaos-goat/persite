Wolfenstein 3d style shooter with a “Venusian” gangsta rap soundtrack. Gameplay is rad because levels are short and sweet unlike Wolfenstein's labyrinths and all the guns feel great to use (which is like 90% about how they sound, 10% about how they act). Takes about thirty minutes to an hour to beat and is worth the time spent with the soundtrack.
