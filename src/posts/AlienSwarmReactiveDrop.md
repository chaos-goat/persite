4 player co-op top down twin stick shooter about killing aliens that are definitely totally legally distinct from xenomoprhs and warhammer 40k tyranids/starcraft zerg. It’s hard as balls and has five campaigns of varying difficulty and length. Lots to unlock, see and do in this one and it’s got a pretty sick deathmatch mode.
