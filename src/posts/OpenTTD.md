Do you like logistics games like Factorio? Do you like beating your head against a wall trying to make mail delivery profitable (it will never be profitable)? Do you like Simcity but thought it needed more accounting? Thatâ€™s what Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe is: economic warfare and the constant struggle to make a buck. American as Hell. Will run on a literal toaster to boot.
