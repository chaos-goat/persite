RotMG is a bullet hell MMO with permadeath and there is just a ton to unpack there. It is a bullet hell so you fire streams of bullets like you’re in a shmup/bullet hell game and so do all enemies. It is an MMO so you’re dealing with large player counts where each world can hold about 80 players at a time and multiple worlds are active at once. Permadeath is why people call it a roguelike sometimes but really all it means is when your character dies you start over. This is not nearly as punishing as it sounds and leveling to max level takes under an hour to a couple of hours depending on what you’re doing. Things going for this game are that it’s free, it’s a unique concept and there is a lot to do. This is a freemium game so be warned there is a cash shop but you can get tons of enjoyment out of this game without paying a cent and I think it’s not the worst game to support if you decide to throw a buck or five its way.
