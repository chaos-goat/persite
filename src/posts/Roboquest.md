The future sucks man, humans wander the wasteland while robots control what remains of the cities. That is until a plucky young girl boots up two **BRObots** to kick some robotic ass. You mission is to destroy bots, get ridiculous weapons (laser chainsaws, bouncing energy launchers, toys that shoot for you, just an absolute smorgasbord of fever dream weapons remixing Borderlands and Doom 2), and take the world back for your human homies. This is like the perfect game to play with a buddy: It has a high skill cap, short runs, a groove you can slip into, and the music ***slaps***. The art style has this wonderful cell shaded look and the weapons all have comic book style visual sound effects (rat-tat-tat-tat style) and there are lots of cool secrets and unlocks to be found. And the movement is *divine*. Double jumps, crouch slides, head stomps, rails to grind on: *Perfection*.
