A game inspired by X-COM but is neither a remake or a sequel. Has the same core split gameplay loop of a base and strategy management section followed by turn based tactics battles. UFO:AI runs on a modified version of the Quake 2 engine and looks pretty decent, you’re not gonna get something that looks like Firaxis’ XCOM but it looks better and is friendlier than the 93 X-COM that it is inspired by. Supports Co-op and versus multiplayer and the co-op is pretty radical for anyone that has dabbled in [Xcommanderless playthroughs of XCOM 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5zZwCxZk-g).
