This game is an action platformer with a gun game style ruleset: every box you pick up changes your weapon. Survive as long as you can as the game gets tougher. Weapons are a good mix of solid shooter classics and more unique options like the disc gun (buzzsaw blades) or how dual pistols fire both in front and behind you. Not much to say about this beyond that it is a good arcade style game and tons of fun. And we Stan good arcade style games.
