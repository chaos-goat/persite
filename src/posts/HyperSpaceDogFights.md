This game is a lot like ***Luftrausers***. If that doesn't mean anything to you consider this a recommendation for that game as well. You're a plane, or plane like object viewed side on and have control over your thrust and facing while gravity constantly drags you down. Effectively this means you're constantly fighting with the physics to get you where you need to be which is firing at ground units, avoiding other air units, and killing bosses. Super arcade-y, with a reasonably high skill ceiling and both have striking graphics. Pics for ***Luftrausers*** included as well. Hyperspace Dogfights is more roguelite with random upgrade choices, Luftrausers is a more considered apporach where you choose specific engines, weapons and bodies for your plane all with different effects. You **WILL** be cursing this game and muttering *"just one more run..."*.
