Eldritch is a weird one. It looks a bit like a lovecraftian Minecraft, all blocky voxels and chunky textures. It plays like a dungeoncrawling immsersive sim being almost similar to Ultima Underworld at first but actually... its a speedrunner and I'll die on this hill. I don't really dig speedrunning games normally but moving fast ends up being super satisfying, and the mad dash scramble to go through levels as fast as possible feels so good. Runs are short at maybe 20 - 30 minutes per and the difficulty scale is good with lots of enemies to learn how best to deal with. Check it out!
