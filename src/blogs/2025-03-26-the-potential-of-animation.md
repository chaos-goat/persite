title: The Potential of Animation
---
I love talking to people. I love talking about anything and everything. This might surprise some (I doubt it) but I'm an extrovert. I'm an extrovert with extremely strong opinions though and when I run into different viewpoints that I don't understand my initial instinct is to interrogate that person, not in a "how dare you think that way, defend your position!" sense, but in a trying to get to the root of why they think that way. I _WANT_ to understand. Not agree with, though I'm always open to being wrong, but just get what made them think that way.

How does this tie into animation? In my online wanderings and discourses and probably <sup>definitely</sup> annoying the shit out of people I've run into a viewpoint that has never really made sense to me:

> "Animation is not as good as live action."

Sadly, I've never been able to really dig into this as much as I'd like to, say over a nice beer or coffee and really gnaw on it for awhile, but the gist seems to be one of _emotion_: that live action portrays emotion better than animation does and therefore live action remakes are good because of that. I can count on one hand the amount of live action remakes of animated properties that I consider good:

*   Speed Racer
    
*   Battle Angel Alita
    
*   Scooby Doo\*
    

_\*_: _\*SORT OF\*_

Really, I tried to think of more but I've avoided them because so many are bad: Death Note (American), Casshern, Devilman (2004), Attack on Titan, Ghost in the Shell, etc. I've seen most of the Disney "live action" (Lion King is CGI still goddamnit) remakes and they just really don't do it for me. Cruella gets a soft pass because I like the punkish-attitude but it's still very by the Disney numbers. As an aside: origin stories kind of suck in superhero movies and they suck even more in these animated remakes or, in Cruella's case, spinoffs. No spoilers but her villain origin story might be the dumbest thing Disney has ever done.

So here's the deal: I'm gonna lay out my main argument in favor of animation, especially adult animation, and then provide examples for why animation is better and examples of badass things to watch.
