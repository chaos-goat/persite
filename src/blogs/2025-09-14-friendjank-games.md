title: Friendjank Games
---
I was talking with a friend about so called [Friendslop](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/friendslop) games and in attempting to define them I found this [substack](https://exploringthegames.substack.com/p/what-is-friendslop-lethal-company-co-op-games). Good work defining it and they give some pretty basic recommendations, I'd like to follow up with some more but first I want to blab about these games for a bit.

Now I don't like the slop part of the name, that to me feels negative. I'd have called it friendjank which probably sounds as negative but when I use jank like that I mean it in a positive way. It's janky sure, but it has _flavor_. Anyways - this "new" breed of game really intrigues me. I don't actually _like_ any of them. Like not a single goddamn one, but I _love_ playing them with my friends. Even beyond the normal "I'm having fun because I'm playing with my friends whom I could have fun watching paint dry with." kind of way. Something about the mix of the games wackiness and friends really makes them pop for me. On the one hand it's like watching horror movies with a group - they're always best experienced with other people. On the other it adds in the frustration of screaming at a friend to "PIVOT!" when carrying a couch upstairs, but in a fun way.
