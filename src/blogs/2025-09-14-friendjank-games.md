title: Friendjank Games
---
I was talking with a friend about so called [Friendslop](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/friendslop) games and in attempting to define them I found this [substack](https://exploringthegames.substack.com/p/what-is-friendslop-lethal-company-co-op-games). Good work defining it and they give some pretty basic recommendations, I'd like to follow up with some more but first I want to blab about these games for a bit.

I'm also gonna call it friendjank instead of friendslop because slop squicks me out. Sorry Gen Zers and Alphas. I got old I guess.

## Escape the Backrooms

If you had told me I'd like this game before last year I wouldn't have believed you. I don't like janky bullshit physics and "so bad it's good" (but really it's bad) gameplay. But what drew me in is the creativity and breadth of stuff in this game. I'm not even super into the backrooms as a fictional conceit, I just loved playing through bite size levels that were all different in vibe from each other. And as a co-op game it's pretty decent, it has a nice challenge gradient with more players being added.

Of particular interest are the levels like Light's Out which uses a sonar like device to paint dots over a pitch black maze so you can find your way. Very reminiscent of Scanner Sombre. Or Level 9223372036854775807 which is an infinite staircase. Yeah, there's a trick to it, figure it out. Or the creepy ass song heard in the party level:

> Yesterday, I saw Fred,
> 
> To return his collarbone
> 
> made of bread,
> 
> may I taste your bladder?
> 
> I'm craving some
> 
> GUY-GRAVY!
> 
> Moisten your calender...

_So creepy._

## Space Beast Terror Fright

You're a big badass space marine in charge of destroying a ship that's been infested with aliens. You need to get in, download all the data, and shut off the coolant to the reactor so the ship will blow up. The only problem? You're also basically made of tissue paper, you're so big a max of two of your group of four can be abreast in a hallway and friendly fire isn't so much a possibility as a definitely going to happen. Remember kids: Friendly fire _isn't_. This game does a couple of really neat things: Your character when being chased by aliens, running back to the airlock while the self destruct timer is going off, or when loud noises jump scares will run faster and your vision will get distorted. Very good for putting you in this erstwhile marine's shoes. You have a live camera feed to the POVs of your teammates, so you can see them get eaten in real time. Sentry guns are your best friends but have no problem shooting through you to kill enemies. There is a pretty broad array of upgrades you can acquire provided you can stay alive long enough. And the game has an extremely adjustable difficulty level. I've bought this game for at least ten different people and love showing new people it. Great for a few hours of arcadey fun every few months.
