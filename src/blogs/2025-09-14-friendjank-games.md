title: Friendjank Games
---
I was talking with a friend about so called [Friendslop](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/friendslop) games and in attempting to define them I found this [substack](https://exploringthegames.substack.com/p/what-is-friendslop-lethal-company-co-op-games). Good work defining it and they give some pretty basic recommendations, I'd like to follow up with some more but first I want to blab about these games for a bit.

I'm also gonna call it friendjank instead of friendslop because slop squicks me out. Sorry Gen Zers and Alphas. I got old I guess.

## Escape the Backrooms

If you had told me I'd like this game before last year I wouldn't have believed you. I don't like janky bullshit physics and "so bad it's good" (but really it's bad) gameplay. But what drew me in is the creativity and breadth of stuff in this game. I'm not even super into the backrooms as a fictional conceit, I just loved playing through bite size levels that were all different in vibe from each other. And as a co-op game it's pretty decent, it has a nice challenge gradient with more players being added.

Of particular interest are the levels like Light's Out which uses a sonar like device to paint dots over a pitch black maze so you can find your way. Very reminiscent of Scanner Sombre. Or Level 9223372036854775807 which is an infinite staircase. Yeah, there's a trick to it, figure it out. Or the creepy ass song heard in the party level:

> Yesterday, I saw Fred,
> 
> To return his collarbone
> 
> made of bread,
> 
> may I taste your bladder?
> 
> I'm craving some
> 
> GUY-GRAVY!
> 
> Moisten your calender...

_So creepy._
