Well this is my first Blaugust post after spinning my wheels on what was meant to be my first post.

The best way to confront these anxieties is with people, likeminded freaks who also want to peel back the scabs of society and see what squirms beneath. There is an energy to a crowd, especially an appreciative crowd. It's not super different from the midnight showing crowds.
