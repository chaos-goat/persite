title: Your Roguelikes Aren't Roguelikes... Sort Of.
---
I love taunting people with forthcoming blog posts that will never actually come... but sometimes it has me thinking. And then the blogpost comes.

This is my 3rd time trying to write this and each time I get stuck in the morass of explaining the dreaded _video game genre_. Here's this thing, this is my thesis statement here: video game genres are nearly meaningless. Hold on, hear me out. As I sit here, at a laundromat on a Sunday morning typing this out on my phone, this post is titled "Your Roguelikes aren't Roguelikes... Sort of." and while that title may change that is the impetus behind this post.

Genre exists as a way to classify and categorize things. That and maybe enabling comparison of similar things is pretty much it's only use. In literature its comprised of tone, setting, length, style.

As consumers the comparison helps us find things that are like other things we already like.

Those tomatoes are from the wonderful [Yequari](https://yequari.com/) and [emma](https://emmas.place/index.html). They're right to throw tomatoes since that could easily be a gatekeeping statement but that's not really how I mean it. Lets talk about game genre.

Genre in video games is different than music, film, literature in that while it's used to categorize things the same way the method of categorization is in how you interact with the work. Instead of being stylistic, tonal, length, setting, etc based like it is in other media in video games it's a lot more nebulous. Take RPGs: What does RPG mean in a game sense? I've had discussions with friends where they'll say things like "Well, you're playing a role, so everything is an RPG." And while I'm truly all in on reductive arguments like that; a role playing game (in video game terms) isn't about playing a role. There is a history to the term that influences how it's used. It means it's like a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) like Dungeons and Dragons. And it generally means you have stats, and a system for leveling up. That's all RPG on it's own means with video games. That right there, that extremely specific mechanics based focus is why you get this soup of genres when games are described. Just some examples from my steam wishlist:

*   "top-down arcade racing"
    
*   "A dungeon exploration RPG specializing in hack-and-slash."
    
*   "isometric real-time tactics"
    
*   "casual city-building and dungeon-management"
    

Now, developers have been learning and moving away from using these descriptions, I think [Animal Well](https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/) for example has a wonderful description:

> Explore a dense, interconnected labyrinth, and unravel its many secrets. Collect items to manipulate your environment in surprising and meaningful ways. Encounter beautiful and unsettling creatures, as you attempt to survive what lurks in the dark. There is more than what you see.

But as consumers, gamers, nerds, whatever you want to call people who play games we mostly still try to shorthand game descriptions. So Animal Well instead becomes a "metroidvania" or maybe a "retro pixel metroidvania".

As an aside if you're wondering where metroidvania comes from or what it means: It was used to describe Castlevania games starting with Symphony of the Night that were more like Super Metroid than older Castlevania games. Older Castlevania games were action (meaning you attack things) platformers, I would say fairly difficult ones. Super Metroid was the same but it had non linear levels where you had to acquire upgrades to access new areas and progress, so there is an element of exploration and memorization involved in it. Funnily enough the Symphony of the Night team was more inspired by Zelda than they were Metroid which has a lot of the same mechanical elements but because it's (generally) not a platformer its treated as being completely different. At this point I hope you're starting to agree that video game genre is meaningless.

Why does this matter? Well like most things with games and talking about them, really it doesn't. But I am personally quite annoyed when I want to talk about Roguelikes and people instead respond like I'm talking about Roguelikes. Or less frequently I want to talk about Roguelikes and people think I mean Roguelikes instead.

No you didn't have a stroke and neither did I. Roguelike describes a specific kind of turn based CRPG (Computer RPG, think old school) dungeon crawler (mostly). It also describes the combination of Procedural Generation and Run Based Gameplay (or Permadeath, though I think that's a misnomer in these games) when splashed into something else, generally a twin stick shooter, an action platformer, an FPS etc etc etc. Confused? Cool, so is everyone else. Before I go on I will admit this is an incredibly tired argument but I was to stress: I'm not really saying one is right or wrong. I'm saying genre is meaningless and I'm showing my work.

So: Roguelikes.

There is a thing called the "[Berlin Interpretation](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation)" to formally define roguelikes - i.e. games like Rogue. This is a mixture of high and low value characteristics present in most "Roguelikes" that should be read as descriptive and not prescriptive. Not all roguelikes will have all of these, not all games that have some or even most are roguelikes.
