title: Your Roguelikes Aren't Roguelikes... Sort Of.
---
I love taunting people with forthcoming blog posts that will never actually come... but sometimes it has me thinking. And then the blogpost comes.

Those tomatoes are from the wonderful [Yequari](https://yequari.com/) and [emma](https://emmas.place/index.html). They're right to throw tomatoes since that could easily be a gatekeeping statement but that's not really how I mean it. Lets talk about game genre.

Genre in video games is different than music, film, literature in that while it's used to categorize things the same way the method of categorization is in how you interact with the work. Instead of being stylistic, tonal, length, setting, etc based like it is in other media in video games it's a lot more nebulous. Take RPGs: What does RPG mean in a game sense? I've had discussions with friends where they'll say things like "Well, you're playing a Role, so everything is an RPG." And while I'm truly all in on reductive arguments like that; a role playing game (in video game terms) isn't about playing a role. There is a history to the term that influences how it's used. It means it's like a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) like Dungeons and Dragons. And it generally means you have stats, and a system for leveling up. That's all RPG on it's own means with video games. That right there, that extremely specific mechanics based focus is why you get this soup of genres when games are described. Just some examples from my steam wishlist:

*   "top-down arcade racing"
    
*   "A dungeon exploration RPG specializing in hack-and-slash."
    
*   "isometric real-time tactics"
    
*   "casual city-building and dungeon-management"
    

Now, developers have been learning and moving away from using these descriptions, I think [Animal Well](https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/) for example has a wonderful description:

> Explore a dense, interconnected labyrinth, and unravel its many secrets. Collect items to manipulate your environment in surprising and meaningful ways. Encounter beautiful and unsettling creatures, as you attempt to survive what lurks in the dark. There is more than what you see.

But as consumers, gamers, nerds, nutjobs, whatever you want to call people who play games we mostly still try to shorthand game descriptions. So Animal Well instead becomes a "metroidvania" or maybe a "retro pixel metroidvania".

As an aside if you're wondering where metroidvania comes from or what it means: It was used to describe Castlevania games starting with Symphony of the Night
