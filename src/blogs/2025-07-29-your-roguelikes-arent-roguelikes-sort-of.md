title: Your Roguelikes Aren't Roguelikes... Sort Of.

I love taunting people with forthcoming blog posts that will never actually come... but sometimes it has me thinking. And then the blogpost comes.

Those tomatoes are from the wonderful [Yequari](https://yequari.com/) and [emma](https://emmas.place/index.html). They're right to throw tomatoes since that could easily be a gatekeeping statement but that's not really how I mean it. Lets talk about game genre, specifically lets talk about how game genre is largely pointless.

What's genre? In literature it's a combination of setting, tone, technique and you compound genres together for accuracy: the Dresden Files which is a series I love would be Fiction>Narrative Fiction>Speculative Fiction>Fantasy>Urban Fantasy and you can shorthand all that by just talking about Urban Fantasy. Cool.

In music it's a mixture of the sound, the style, the method of production, and sometimes the culture/ethnicity/etc of the person(s) making the music that determines what genre it is.

That's interesting though right? Same word: Genre. Two wildly different methods of determining how it's used in categorizing the work.

Video game genre is also different, it's almost wholly down to how you interact with the medium, i.e. it's the mechanics of a game that matter.
