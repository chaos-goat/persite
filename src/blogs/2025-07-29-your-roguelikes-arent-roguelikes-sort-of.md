title: Your Roguelikes Aren't Roguelikes... Sort Of.
---
I love taunting people with forthcoming blog posts that will never actually come... but sometimes it has me thinking. And then the blogpost comes.

Don't worry! I'm not gatekeeping your roguelikes, my roguelikes aren't roguelikes either because video game genre is _meaningless_. Do I have your attention? I hope that sounds as bold as I think it does. Here's the deal, we (humans... and especially nerds) **LOVE** to categorize things. Like seriously, we're kind of pathological about it, have you ever looked at music genres like on [musicmap](https://musicmap.info/)? It's nuts.

Also I love that I happened to grab a screenshot that included d-beat while I'm listening to [some](https://dischargeofficialmusic.bandcamp.com/track/state-violence-state-control). It's not for everyone but it fits the internal cacophony in my head at all times. Anyways back on topic - we categorize things pathologically and I'd argue for cinema and literature that mostly works. You can view both of those through the lens of the author/auteur as well but when it comes to comparing and contrasting films/books or finding things similar to what you already like the way we use genre to categorize things works really well. I think in general it falls apart a bit with music, we hybridize things so aggressively in music that you end up in the weird realm of microgenres really quickly and that's not exactly helpful. For example: I like a lot of witch house but what I'm really saying there is I like synthwave with an occult aesthetic, both visually and aurally. It's so niche I don't think it's particularly useful as a point of comparison, especially since at least part of that microgenre is visually aesthetic in nature which is weird to include in music. I don't like Judas Priest because of the leather daddy/biker aesthetic, I like them because they're ass kicking metal.

So how does that relate to genre in video games? When we talk about game genre there are two things I think that work against it. The first is that a lot of genre names/descriptions rely on historical context to make sense and without that they lose a lot of their intended meaning: Adventure, Simulation, RPG are categories that have all become at least somewhat meaningless. Bullethell has a fairly specific (though like all video game genres largely vibes based) meaning but gets applied to most STG/Shmups indiscriminately. Then it gets use

This is my 3rd time trying to write this and each time I get stuck in the morass of explaining the dreaded _video game genre_. Here's this thing, this is my thesis statement here: video game genres are nearly meaningless. Hold on, hear me out. As I sit here, at a laundromat on a Sunday morning typing this out on my phone, this post is titled "Your Roguelikes aren't Roguelikes... Sort of." and while that title may change that is the impetus behind this post.

Genre exists as a way to classify and categorize things. In literature and film genre is comprised of tone, setting, length, style, mood, theme. And it makes sense that they're so linked since film criticism borrows so much from literary theory. If you use the same tools to critically look at two different things you'll probably end up categorizing them in similar ways. So how does this relate to video game genre? Video game genres are mechanics driven owing to the interactive nature of the medium.

This leads to something weird that I don't see with film and literary genres: confusion about what a thing is. Also using the Ur example of something as a shorthand genre itself. Let me explain:

When first person shooters started exploding in popularity they weren't called that at first. They were called Doom clones. As games separated themselves from Dooms specific brand of frenetic gameplay we settled on calling them First Person Shooters. That doesn't tell you anything about the games theme, tone, setting, etc. just about how you interact with it. You have a first person perspective and you're "shooting" things (in Hexen you might be stabbing things, but the concept is the same. Interacting violently with the world.) While I like first person shooters, I don't like them because they're a first person shooter. I like the nexus of theme, tone, gameplay (not just the FPS part... Does it have leveling and stats? Does it have puzzle solving? Is it basically a bullet hell (looking at you Heretic)? Does it have strategy elements? Is it Co op, single player, an MMO.) the way we use genre with video games is incredibly limited compared to how we interact with them and what makes us like them.

Steam, and most other game stores, solve this by adding up to 20 genre tags to a game via user submission. There are huge holes in that approach though; some tags are hyper specific and not necessarily helpful to telling you much about the game (Dwarves) and some are too broad terms that once had a specific meaning but now either have effectively no meaning (Adventure) or multiple mutually exclusive meanings (Simulation). And some have two meanings that exist at different Levels of Detail (shit, my tableau developer is coming out). So let's talk about Roguelikes.

What is a Roguelike? Either it's a specific kind of dungeon crawler that is like Rogue, hence the name, or it's a game that includes procedural generation, high randomness, and permanent death (sort of) as a set of mechanics which were big parts of Rogue and maybe the most stylistically important. Think Caves of Qud on the one hand, Balatro on the other. Two levels of detail: a specific sub style (Roguelike), of a sub style(Dungeon Crawler), of RPGs OR twoish specific mechanics splashed in to a game to add to its own genre soup of mechanics. Balatro is a Roguelike Deckbuilder which is a fairly succinct mechanics soup to describe it with. You build a deck, have lots of randomness, and the game loop is run based like an arcade game with meta progression. Caves of Qud is an RPG set in an open, living world that features questing, dungeons, emergent gameplay, etc. Two wildly different game types, same genre description.

Some people will get around this by calling things like Balatro a Roguelite but I've never liked that. First to understand it requires prior knowledge of a different specific genre and how it's been boiled down to a couple mechanics. Second it being referential is just weird, it can't stand on its own like that. And third that opens up the door for things like Simulation and Adventure games where it becomes meaningless goop. A whole lot of Roguelites are action platformers that seem quite a bit like a Metroidvania if you're not used to the differences between them. Hell they might actually be metroidvanias sometimes so how long before it becomes a completely meaningless descriptor and conflated with that? Okay this is the last time I'll do this but let's talk about Metroidvanias.

Those tomatoes are from the wonderful [Yequari](https://yequari.com/) and [emma](https://emmas.place/index.html). They're right to throw tomatoes since that could easily be a gatekeeping statement but that's not really how I mean it. Lets talk about game genre.

Genre in video games is different than music, film, literature in that while it's used to categorize things the same way the method of categorization is in how you interact with the work. Instead of being stylistic, tonal, length, setting, etc based like it is in other media in video games it's a lot more nebulous. Take RPGs: What does RPG mean in a game sense? I've had discussions with friends where they'll say things like "Well, you're playing a role, so everything is an RPG." And while I'm truly all in on reductive arguments like that; a role playing game (in video game terms) isn't about playing a role. There is a history to the term that influences how it's used. It means it's like a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) like Dungeons and Dragons. And it generally means you have stats, and a system for leveling up. That's all RPG on it's own means with video games. That right there, that extremely specific mechanics based focus is why you get this soup of genres when games are described. Just some examples from my steam wishlist:

*   "top-down arcade racing"
    
*   "A dungeon exploration RPG specializing in hack-and-slash."
    
*   "isometric real-time tactics"
    
*   "casual city-building and dungeon-management"
    

Now, developers have been learning and moving away from using these descriptions, I think [Animal Well](https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/) for example has a wonderful description:

> Explore a dense, interconnected labyrinth, and unravel its many secrets. Collect items to manipulate your environment in surprising and meaningful ways. Encounter beautiful and unsettling creatures, as you attempt to survive what lurks in the dark. There is more than what you see.

But as consumers, gamers, nerds, whatever you want to call people who play games we mostly still try to shorthand game descriptions. So Animal Well instead becomes a "metroidvania" or maybe a "retro pixel metroidvania".

As an aside if you're wondering where metroidvania comes from or what it means: It was used to describe Castlevania games starting with Symphony of the Night that were more like Super Metroid than older Castlevania games. Older Castlevania games were action (meaning you attack things) platformers, I would say fairly difficult ones. Super Metroid was the same but it had non linear levels where you had to acquire upgrades to access new areas and progress, so there is an element of exploration and memorization involved in it. Funnily enough the Symphony of the Night team was more inspired by Zelda than they were Metroid which has a lot of the same mechanical elements but because it's (generally) not a platformer its treated as being completely different. At this point I hope you're starting to agree that video game genre is meaningless.

Why does this matter? Well like most things with games and talking about them, really it doesn't. But I am personally quite annoyed when I want to talk about Roguelikes and people instead respond like I'm talking about Roguelikes. Or less frequently I want to talk about Roguelikes and people think I mean Roguelikes instead.

No you didn't have a stroke and neither did I. Roguelike describes a specific kind of turn based CRPG (Computer RPG, think old school) dungeon crawler (mostly). It also describes the combination of Procedural Generation and Run Based Gameplay (or Permadeath, though I think that's a misnomer in these games) when splashed into something else, generally a twin stick shooter, an action platformer, an FPS etc etc etc. Confused? Cool, so is everyone else. Before I go on I will admit this is an incredibly tired argument but I was to stress: I'm not really saying one is right or wrong. I'm saying genre is meaningless and I'm showing my work.

So: Roguelikes.

There is a thing called the "[Berlin Interpretation](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation)" to formally define roguelikes - i.e. games like Rogue. This is a mixture of high and low value characteristics present in most "Roguelikes" that should be read as descriptive and not prescriptive. Not all roguelikes will have all of these, not all games that have some or even most are roguelikes.
