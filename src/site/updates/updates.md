- 7/3/24 
    - Swapped colors in main CSS to variables, added extremely rudimentary dark mode support (it's not good).
    - changed font spacing for like the thirtieth time, we may keep this, we may not. WHO KNOWS?!

- 6/30/24 - I don't update this list nearly as often as I should: 

    - Shrines:

        - 6/21/24 New [32bit.cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) code jam page created: [Travelocalpyse](/travelocalypse/) a post apocalyptic travel agency that's effectively a hub for post apocalyptic media recommendations.

    - Blogs:

        - Known Space Part 1 Added - first in a series about two intertwined book series I'm reading.

    - Site Updates:
        - finally fixed mobile CSS, no longer displays only 4 words per line. Make sure when you test your layouts, you're using a good test!
        - My Nav link styling is no longer infecting the rest of my links
        - linespacing and fontsize are now done in rem instead of em - spacing is tighter, but it looks better.
        - To Do: Adding a prefers dark mode.

    - Game Recs:
        - Working on a having site regeneration automated for them so I can uploaded them as I think about it.
        - 2/24/24 - Roboquest
        - 1/7/24 - Soko Loco Deluxe
        - 1/7/24 - Furious Angels

- 2/24/24 - Blog post added, Atom and json feeds added, new game added to game recs (Roboquest), changes default font choice on the site to system fonts and messed with sizing a bit.
- 1/7/24 - Updated the majority of the site to use semantic html, in prep for adding aria labels.
- 1/1/24 - Blog added.
- 12/15/23
    - first blog post stating I have no idea what I'm doing with a blog post
    - WIP uses page updated.
    - New game added: Hyperspace Dogfights! *(and luftrausers)*
    - updates entries will be shorter from now on

- 12/12/23 - Multiple updates over the past couple days, at some point this pace will slow down but not yet.

    - Blog added, no posts yet.

        - Working on RSS feed, this is in prep for the 32bit.cafe's Upcomming Blog Club.
    
    - New Game added to my Breathless Game Recommendations list: Teleglitch!

        - this may end up having it's own RSS feed.

    - My To Do List has exploded for sites and pages I want to create... at least when my pace of changes to the site for functionality slows down I have stuff to create lol.

- 12/9/23 - Second deploy (it's the same) but with Github Actions this time. Very nice, much wow.

    - I swear the neocities drag n drop uploader is the weirdest thing ever, Yeah sure when I upload a folder containing multiple folders I definitely want you to grab all the files in those sub folders but not the sub folders themselves. What the hell.

    - Oh I guess I also fixed my PFP in the about section and added a media query to make it stack on smaller screens. That's better than it going microscopic lol.

    - I've added more blinkies and badges to the front page, I'm unsure about keeping them, but we'll try this retro as hell thing out. Maybe I'll end up making my own.

    - And I added this updates page, a credits page, and a links page. Busy day.

- 12/8/23 - Initial site deploy using 11ty, old site is dead, kaput, donezos!
