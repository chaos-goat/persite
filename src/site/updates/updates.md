- 12/15/23
    - first blog post stating I have no idea what I'm doing with a blog post
    - WIP uses page updated.
    - New game added: Hyperspace Dogfights! *(and luftrausers)*
    - updates entries will be shorter from now on

- 12/12/23 - Multiple updates over the past couple days, at some point this pace will slow down but not yet.

    - Blog added, no posts yet.

        - Working on RSS feed, this is in prep for the 32bit.cafe's Upcomming Blog Club.
    
    - New Game added to my Breathless Game Recommendations list: Teleglitch!

        - this may end up having it's own RSS feed.

    - My To Do List has exploded for sites and pages I want to create... at least when my pace of changes to the site for functionality slows down I have stuff to create lol.

- 12/9/23 - Second deploy (it's the same) but with Github Actions this time. Very nice, much wow.

    - I swear the neocities drag n drop uploader is the weirdest thing ever, Yeah sure when I upload a folder containing multiple folders I definitely want you to grab all the files in those sub folders but not the sub folders themselves. What the hell.

    - Oh I guess I also fixed my PFP in the about section and added a media query to make it stack on smaller screens. That's better than it going microscopic lol.

    - I've added more blinkies and badges to the front page, I'm unsure about keeping them, but we'll try this retro as hell thing out. Maybe I'll end up making my own.

    - And I added this updates page, a credits page, and a links page. Busy day.

- 12/8/23 - Initial site deploy using 11ty, old site is dead, kaput, donezos!
