### Software

- [Tiddly Wiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

    A single HTML file which works as a notebook, this is also just a ridiculously extensible and customizable tool that can be everything you need it to be: knowledge store, journal, blog, website, to do list, chart generator, non linear book... you name it, you can probably do it with TiddlyWiki. It's also the biggest shortcoming of it.

    - [TiddlyPWA](https://tiddly.packett.cool/)

    Allows you to host and sync your TiddlyWiki for offline updates and syncing accross devices. This is a super cool way to use it.

- [Feather Wiki](https://feather.wiki/)

    It's like Tiddlywiki but smaller, for no apparent reason. I love using this for creating dedicated help files and cheat sheets for specific subjects.

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

    It's the static site generator I used for this site, love it.

- [Depressureizer](https://github.com/Depressurizer/Depressurizer)

    I've got too damn many games on Steam, this helps me keep them in line. You would not believe how many games I've banished to the nether realms on Steam.

- [Electric Zine Maker](https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker)

    Electric Zine Maker kicks ass, make dope 8 page mini zines with a super glitchy aesthetic. I use them to make album recommendations for people.

### Handhelds

- Steam Deck OG and OLED

    I love my steam deck. That is all.

    Okay no it's not, I love the Steam Deck so much I have two, I bought an OLED Limited Edition because I don't have that thing that normal people call "self control". I love playing weird ass indie games in public at coffee shops on it.

- Playdate

    I cannot recommend this based on price it is absolutely too expensive. But it's such a unique little handheld with a cool community behind it that I can't help but love it and personally don't regret buying it. See above comment about self control.

- Anbernic 351p

    It's fine. I got it specifically for Gameboy Advance games and don't regret it, but it's a bit small for my giant hands. Good little handheld just there is an emphasis on little.
