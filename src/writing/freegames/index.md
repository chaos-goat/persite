# Free Games That Don't Suck # 
*A Brief Forward*:

The goal of this guide is to provide an answer to my friends that have bought PCs and are left with an *“and now what?”* reaction. Even if you can afford to start dropping stacks on games maybe you don’t want to. Maybe you shouldn’t. Maybe you don’t know what the hell you like. This guide is intended to help with at least some of that.

The PC is a bit of a different beast to consoles when it comes to what games are available for a couple reasons: the truly staggering backlog the PC has and the ability to use a mouse and keyboard. 

The mouse and keyboard difference is simply the mouse makes UIs more navigable and useful and then you can have a more complex game when you have tens of buttons at your disposal for hotkeying. PC games don't have to be complicated but they can be more complicated than their console counterparts if they need to be.

The backlog is the more interesting wrinkle to PC gaming. The console with the most games is probably the PlayStation 2 with 4,500 games give or take. On Steam alone there have been **11,627 games** released. *And that was just in 2021*. The scope and scale of the library of potential titles on PC just dwarfs any other platform. Which in turn creates a discoverability *nightmare* for games, especially for free ones. I’m hoping I can do just a small bit to help with that and as such I’m going to skip extremely popular and well known free games such as Apex Legends, Fortnite, Warframe and Path of Exile. Hell I’d only even recommend two of those.
