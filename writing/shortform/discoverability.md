# Curation

Curation is a form of creation. I'd argue considered, deliberate, and intentional curation is art even. The thought that gets put into the curation of a collection makes it art, and I think that is an incredibly important facet of discoverability. Make no mistake here: I'm not talking about being beholden to tastemakers, or algorithims, or the dreaded AI apocalypse coming for us all. The curation that I'm interested in is human curation, a person going *"hmmm... yes these objects belong together."* and the reasoning behind that. That's interesting. That's fascinating. That's ***VALUE***.  

Now... Curation as creation doesn't consist solely of curating *good* things. Heavens no. Sometimes it's curating the things that interested you, and believe me, being interested in something because it's bad is one thousand percent a legitimate reason to curate a collection of these objects. It's a damn sight more interesting than being interested in something because it won an award... *unless the awards themselves are weird.* That's more or less beside the point my point here is: The curation that I'm interested in isn't a listicle, it isn't everything that fits some broad criteria, and it isn't endless. To have value I think it needs a limit of some sort, there needs to be air for the collection to breath. That of course doesn't mean it can't be huge: the goal is for the [/writing/freegames/](Free Games That Don't Suck) and [/writing/gamesrecs/](Breathless Game Recommendations) sections of this site to be massive and utterly briming with quality things that might have gotten overlooked (and lets be honest, I'm the smallest of fishes in this ocean, will still get overlooked but damnit I'm trying!).

So, to recap what I'm interested in curation wise:

1. Intention
2. An Interesting Purpose
3. Limits

How does this relate to game discoverability? Well indie PC games are awash in a *VERY* full ocean, some stats:

game releases per year
indie game releases per year
indie dev stats for success
itch.io stats
